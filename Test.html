# Some cool rendered math

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. `\(\alpha+\beta\)`. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:


`$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$`

# Here is a simple regression


```r
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,


```r
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
